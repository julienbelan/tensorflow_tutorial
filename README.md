Tutorial to Master the TensorFlow Library

**These beginner tutorials take into account you're able to:**
1. open a zip file
2. download software on your computer
3. Basics in Terminal (Mac, Linux) or Command Line (Windows) handling

***Environment: How to set up your computer***
You'll need:
- Anaconda: Library with Python + all the stuff you'll need
- Tensorflow: Library for machine learning
- Keras: TensorFlow simplified library for machine learning

***Downloads: where to get those***
**Anaconda**
1. Go to [Anaconda Installation Website](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
2. Just click on the icon that represent your computer.
3. Click on *Python 2.7 graphical installer*
4. Open the download package (.pkg) and follow the installation instruction making sure to install to the default location, note the location (i.e. this/is/a/location).
5. Now you have the Anaconda application installed with Python 2.7, conda package manager and other cool stuff

**TensorFlow**
1. For Mac and Linux: Open Terminal and type *which pip*
   For Windows: Open Command Line and type *where pip*
2. Make sure that pip is in the installed anaconda location (the one previously noted)
3. Type *pip install tensorflow*
4. Follow the installation instructions

**Keras**
1. Type *pip install Keras*

**Now you have Anaconda with Tensorflow installed on your computer and this complete the environment**

***Jupyter and Github: How to get going***
**GitHub**
GitHub is where you are standing now, it's a shared place to get the tutorials, ask question or report issues.
1. Choose the repository tensorflow_tutorial
2. Click on download *zip* on the right corner
3. Open the zip file

**Jupyter**
1. Open the Anaconda application named Anaconda-Navigator
2. Open Jupyter Notebook, that'll trigger your browser and open a folder page
3. go to the tensorflow_tutorial folder
4. Click on the tutorial you wish to do. Notebook are .pynb extensions.

**Now you can just follow the tutorial but keep it mind:
1. You'll learn by doing so don't just run thing, try to rewrite stuff and take note while going
2. There exists technologies that can wrap all these installation so you can concentrate only on the task: i.e Floyd, Docker, etc. but its better to begin with hands-on traditional installation since most people still use it.
3. Bugs and issues happens, don't hesitate to connect or pull an issue in the *issue* section.
